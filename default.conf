# Video Encoder (H.264, H.265, *).
# This changes which encoder to use.
#
# NOTE: Selecting `*` will allow H.264 or H.265, defaulting to H.264.
# NOTE: H.264 offers siginificantly more compatbility with devices.
# NOTE: H.265 offers 50-75% more compression efficiency.
ENCODER=H.264

# Hardware Acceleration (software, intel, nvidia, mac, amd, quicksync).
# This allows for hardware acceleration using intel or nvidia gpus.
#
# NOTE: THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL.
# NOTE: To use this you will likely need drivers and more.
# NOTE: Hardware Acceleration typically scarifices quality for speed.

# Video Resolution (*).
# This will resize the video maintaining aspect ratio.
#
# NOTE: Examples: `SD, HD, 720p, 1920x1080, 4K`.
# NOTE: Using this option MAY cause Radarr/Sonarr to need a manual import due to file quality not matching grabbed release.

# File/Folder Rename (true, false).
# This will rename the file/folder when resolution is changed.

# NOTE: You must allow the script to run as a global extension (applies to all nzbs in queue) for this to work on NZBGet.
RENAME=false

# Video Bitrate (KB).

# Create Dual Audio Streams (true, false).
# This will create two audio streams, if possible. AAC 2.0 and AC3 5.1.

# Force Audio Convert (true, false).
# Use this to force the audio to convert, overriding all other checks.

# Normalize Audio (true, false).
# This will normalize audio if needed due to downmixing.
NORMALIZE=false

# Force Normalize (true, false).
# This will force check audio levels for all supported audio streams.

# Copy Subtitles (true, false, extract).
# This will copy/convert subtitles of your matching language(s) into the converted file.
