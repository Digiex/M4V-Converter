M4V-Converter
=============

A script designed to convert media to mp4 format.

What does it do exactly? It converts your media to a universal format. Why? Plex! Plex transcodes anything a client cannot play normally but transcoding is a CPU intensive task and if your CPU falls short, soon after the client will begin to buffer. By using this script you will eliminate transcoding or at least cut down on it.

While this script is good it can be better. Please feel free to offer suggestions or pull request.
